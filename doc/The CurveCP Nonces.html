<h2>Nonces in CurveCP</h2>
CurveCP protects data by putting the data into a cryptographic box.
This box is encrypted and authenticated
from a sender's secret key to a receiver's public key.
<p>
Attached to the box is a public 24-byte <b>nonce</b> chosen by the sender.
Nonce means "number used once."
After a particular nonce has been used to encrypt a packet,
the same nonce must never be used to encrypt another packet
from the sender's secret key to this receiver's public key,
and the same nonce must never be used to encrypt another packet
from the receiver's secret key to this sender's public key.
This requirement is essential for cryptographic security.
<p>
There are four different key pairs involved in a CurveCP connection,
using four different types of nonces:
<table border>
<tr><th>Key pair</th><th>Nonce format</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>The server's long-term secret key s and long-term public key S.
The client knows S before making a CurveCP connection.
</td><td>
The 8-byte ASCII string "CurveCPK"
followed by a 16-byte compressed nonce.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The client's long-term secret key c and long-term public key C.

<a href="security.html#forward">forward secrecy</a>.
</td><td>

followed by an 8-byte compressed nonce.
The compressed nonce represents a 64-bit integer in little-endian form.

followed by an 8-byte compressed nonce.
The string is	
"CurveCP-client-H" for a Hello packet,
"CurveCP-client-I" for an Initiate packet,
or
"CurveCP-client-M" for a Message packet.
The compressed nonce represents a 64-bit integer in little-endian form.
These integers are generated in increasing order.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
The rest of this page describes in detail how the CurveCP nonces are chosen
by these four secret keys s, c, s', c'.
<h3>Nonces for short-term keys</h3>
Most CurveCP packets are encrypted by the short-term client secret key c'
or by the short-term server secret key s'.
The short-term client secret key c' uses nonces
"CurveCP-client-H\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0" (containing integer 0),
"CurveCP-client-H\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0" (containing integer 1),
"CurveCP-client-H\2\0\0\0\0\0\0\0" (containing integer 2),
etc. for its Hello packets,
or the same with I instead of H for its Initiate packets,
or the same with M instead of H for its Message packets.
The short-term server secret key s' uses nonces
"CurveCP-server-M\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0",
"CurveCP-server-M\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0",
"CurveCP-server-M\2\0\0\0\0\0\0\0",
etc.
<p>
The client cannot send more than 2^64 packets in this connection;
once its nonce reaches
"CurveCP-client-M\377\377\377\377\377\377\377\377",
it must immediately abort the connection.
Same for the server.
Note that
sending 2^64 packets at a rate of 1 billion packets per second
would take nearly 600 years.
<p>
Each nonce used by the short-term client secret key c'
is strictly larger than all nonces previously used by c'.
("Larger" means that the first 16 bytes are larger or equal in lexicographic order
and that the remaining 8 bytes are larger in reverse lexicographic order.)
Once the server has successfully verified a packet with a particular nonce,
the server is free to immediately discard any packets
whose nonces are the same or smaller
from (allegedly) the same client.
Some servers might keep track of the top two or three nonces
to allow network reordering of a few packets,
but the client must still generate nonces in increasing order.
<p>
Similarly,
each nonce used by the short-term server secret key s'
is strictly larger than all nonces previously used by s'.
<p>
The client is not required to start from 0,
and is not required to increase the integer by precisely 1 for each packet.
Current clients start from a random integer between 0 and 2^48-1,
and then increase the nonce by 1 for each packet,
but servers cannot rely on this behavior.
Similarly,
the server is not required to start from 0,
and is not required to increase the integer by precisely 1 for each packet.
<p>
Note that a spy who intercepts two packets from this connection,
say one packet now and one packet in an hour,
can immediately see how many packets were sent in between,
and can therefore estimate the overall data-sending rate for the connection.
However,
even without the nonces,
a spy can quickly estimate the overall data-sending rate for the connection
by watching for a few consecutive packets.
The number of packets in a connection should not be viewed as hidden information;
clients that want some privacy for this information
need an anonymizing network that combines many connections.
<h3>Nonces for the server's long-term key</h3>
The first packet sent by the server in a CurveCP connection
is a Cookie packet
encrypted by the server's long-term secret key s.
<p>
Nonces for this packet are between
"CurveCPK\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"
and
"CurveCPK\377\377\377\377\377\377\377\377\377\377\377\377\377\377\377\377".
The server is <i>not</i> required to generate these nonces in increasing order.
<p>
The server generates a 16-byte compressed nonce as follows:
concatenate an 8-byte counter with 8 random bytes to obtain a 16-byte block;
encrypt this block invertibly under a secret "nonce key".
Without the encryption, the counter would leak information,
showing each client the number of connections made by other clients.
<p>
A different strategy to avoid leaking nonce information across connections
is to choose nonces as high-precision timestamps
(falling back to counters if timestamps behave oddly).
However,
even if the system's clock is reasonably accurate,
disclosing high-precision clock values
gives away information about the clock hardware,
presumably enough information to fingerprint the server computer
and to leak some information about what is running on the computer.
<p>
An additional problem is that the server might crash,
losing any information it has stored in RAM about the previous counter.
Long-term keys (unlike connections and short-term keys) survive crashes.
To guarantee that counters continue to increase after a crash,
the server periodically stores a safe new counter on disk alongside its key
(e.g., whenever the counter passes a multiple of 1048576,
store the same counter plus 2097152),
and starts from the safe counter in case of a crash.
<h3>Nonce separation</h3>
An administrator can set up several CurveCP servers
sharing a long-term secret key.
The servers then have to support <b>nonce separation</b>:
for example,
the first of four servers is configured to use counters with bottom bits 00,
the second is configured to use counters with bottom bits 01,
the third is configured to use counters with bottom bits 10,
and
the fourth is configured to use counters with bottom bits 11.
<h3>Nonces for the client's long-term key</h3>
The plaintext inside the client's Initiate packet
includes a Vouch subpacket encrypted by the long-term client secret key c.
<p>
Each Vouch nonce is between
"CurveCPV\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"
and
"CurveCPV\377\377\377\377\377\377\377\377\377\377\377\377\377\377\377\377".
The client is <i>not</i> required to generate these nonces in increasing order.
<p>
Current clients choose these nonces in the same way
that servers choose nonces for long-term server keys.
