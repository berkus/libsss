Forming service/protocol pairs in uniform way is a key to good scalability.

MIME types mechanism seems to be good for this, as service is a more generic name, further
refined by protocol, similar to what image/jpeg pair in MIME serves, for example.

A mime-like way of specifying service/protocol is adopted, like "web/http 1.1" where slash
separates service from protocol in writing, but not on the wire level.

Vendor-specific types can have vendor name as a prefix separated by a '-'. For example
'adobe-shockwave/flash'.

A non-standard service or protocol can be prefixed with 'x-', for example 'x-porn/video'

Theoretically, protocols are defined only within a namespace of the umbrella service,
but in practice it also makes sense to reuse the names if the protocol is the same.
For example, 'web/http 1.1' and 'dav/http 1.1' are entirely possible.

Examples of some service/protocol pairs in use:

stream-voice/opus
www/http 1.1
www/spdy
stream-video/vp8
stream-mux/webm          # A multiplexed streaming of audio and video
mettanode/routing
