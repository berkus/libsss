Layering:

Input packets ->> Channel : decode, deframe or FEC ->> Framing

FEC packet used to reconstruct at most 1 lost packet
- no packets lost - drop FEC packet
- 1 packet lost - restore it using FEC and all previous received packets in this FEC run
- >1 packets lost - drop FEC packet and consider other packets lost for real (non-recoverable)

FEC packet handled at Channel layer before going to Framing.

FEC-enabled packet reorder buffer needs to keep at most 256 packets.

(This is Channel layer delay - FEC-able queue)

Then inside Framing each frame is dispatched to either Channel or Stream layer depending on
frame type.

STREAM/ATTACH - to Stream
ACK           - to Channel
PADDING       - skipped
DECONGESTION  - to Channel
DETACH        - to Stream
RESET         - to Stream
CLOSE         - to Channel
SETTINGS      - to Channel
PRIORITY      - to Stream (stream mux?)
